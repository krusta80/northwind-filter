John,


Good job completing the project and adding the README.

Looking at your code it seems like you are well on your way. Good job directivizing your app's components and linking them together using ui-router. Additionally, it seems like you've mastered using resolve to inject data into your states. Two areas for improvement seem to be including error handling for your app (both in middleware and on the client side) and further directivizing. How could you treat your employee, home and product templates as directives?


Good work, see you Tuesday.
